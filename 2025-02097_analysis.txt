Detailed Summary                        : This executive order aims to end what the President deems illegal discrimination and restore merit-based opportunity. It revokes several previous executive orders promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), arguing that DEI policies violate civil rights laws and undermine national unity. The order mandates federal agencies to terminate DEI preferences and directs them to enforce existing civil-rights laws. It also seeks to discourage private sector DEI practices through potential litigation and regulatory action.
