Detailed Summary                        : This Executive Order reinstates and amends Executive Order 13957 (Creating Schedule F in the Excepted Service), aiming to restore accountability within the career civil service, particularly for policy-influencing positions. It emphasizes the President's authority over the executive branch and argues that recent actions by career employees have undermined presidential directives. Key changes include renaming 'Schedule F' to 'Schedule Policy/Career', clarifying procedures for adverse actions, and requiring faithful implementation of administration policies.
