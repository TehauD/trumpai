Detailed Summary                        : This executive order imposes a 25% tariff on Canadian goods due to the influx of illicit drugs across the northern border. The President declares a national emergency based on the public health crisis caused by fentanyl and other drug trafficking, arguing that Canada has failed to adequately address the problem. The order directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to monitor the situation, consult with other agencies, and recommend further action if necessary. Tariffs will be removed when the President determines that Canada has taken sufficient steps to alleviate the crisis.
