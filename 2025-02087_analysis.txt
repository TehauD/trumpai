Detailed Summary                        : This executive order directs the Attorney General not to enforce the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act (the 'Act') for 75 days. The Act prohibits entities from distributing, maintaining, or updating certain foreign adversary controlled applications, including TikTok, within the United States. President Biden argues that the Act's timing interferes with his ability to assess national security and foreign policy implications before its prohibitions take effect.
