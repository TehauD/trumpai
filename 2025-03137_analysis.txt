Detailed Summary                        : This executive order aims to prevent taxpayer-funded benefits from going to illegal aliens. It directs federal agencies to identify and align federally funded programs with the goals of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA), which limits access to public benefits for illegal immigrants. The order also seeks to prevent federal funding from supporting sanctuary policies and to enhance eligibility verification systems.
