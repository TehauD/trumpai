Detailed Summary                        : This executive order imposes sanctions on the International Criminal Court (ICC), alleging it has engaged in illegitimate and baseless actions targeting the United States and Israel. It cites the ICC's investigation of U.S. personnel, including former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as justification for the sanctions.
                                          
                                          The order blocks property and interests in property of individuals associated with the ICC, suspends entry into the United States of ICC officials and their families, and prohibits donations to entities connected to the court. It argues that these measures are necessary to protect U.S. national security and foreign policy interests.
